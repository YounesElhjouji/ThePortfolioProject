# ThePortfolioProject
The Portfolio Project is a small portfolio made with ReactJs and Express. The purpose of this project is not just to create a useful portfolio, but
also to try my hand at Backend and Frontend development, and learn how to make them communicate easily.

Right now the project is able to retrieve the content of a json object, sent from the backend (no server) and display that information.
I tried to make it look like an interesting portfolio idea, instead of having a simple scrolling website, we here have a dynamic web application.
